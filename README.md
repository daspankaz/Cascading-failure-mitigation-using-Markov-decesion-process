Cascading failure mitigation using Markov decesion process:
We developed an approach based on a Markov decision process (MDP) to devise optimal load shedding (LS) strategy to mitigate the risk of cascading failures in power grids. Appropriate actions affecting the dynamics of cascading failures and associated costs for choosing such actions are introduced.
